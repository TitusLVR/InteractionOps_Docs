# Functional "F1/F2/F3/F4/F5" Buttons

Context-sensitive operators that adapt based on:
- Current editor (3D View, UV Editor, etc.)
- Object type and mode
- Selection type (vertices, edges, faces)
- Modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl, Shift)

Each F-key (F1-F5) executes different operations depending on context. Configure hotkeys in addon preferences.
